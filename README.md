Explanation:
createNode(): Creates a new node with the given data.
insertAtEnd(): Inserts a new node at the end of the linked list.
printList(): Prints the linked list.
mergeAndSort(): Merges two unsorted linked lists and sorts them using a simple bubble sort algorithm. First, 
it merges the two lists by inserting their elements into a new list, then it sorts the merged list.
Sample Output:
rust
Copy
List 1: 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 5 -> NULL
List 2: 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> NULL
Merged and Sorted List: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> NULL
This program will successfully merge and sort two unsorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
